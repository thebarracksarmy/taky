# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As taky is a lightweight project (and also infrequently developed of late), it's
developer(s) have decided to not offer an "LTS" release. Users should always use
the most recent version of software.

However, if you discover a vulnerability in the software, and have a special use
case that requires an older version, we'll do our best to accomodate your needs.
However, primary efforts will likely be directed towards the most recent
software release.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.9     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.9   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a vulnerability in taky, please contact it's developers
privately. Feel free to ping on Discord, where you will find them to be most
responsive.

However, if you prefer email, you can send an email to:
